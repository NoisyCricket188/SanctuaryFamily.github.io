The world beyond the walls of the Sanctuary is vast and mysterious. It's a place where old stories are retold and new ones are whispered. I often find myself wondering about the life beyond the safety of the Sanctuary gates. The world outside seems so vast, full of secrets and discoveries. What lies beyond? The air is colder there, the skies darker, and the trees taller. There are rumors of strange creatures and lands filled with wonders.

In the Sanctuary, we are safe, but we have always been curious. This land of ours has its own mysteries and we are always eager to uncover them. I've been thinking about what it would be like to leave the sanctuary's confines and explore the world outside. To truly understand the world, one must venture out and experience it. This journey is filled with excitement and fear. What could be waiting for me beyond the walls?

But there's more than just fear. There's also wonder. The world outside is a land filled with new sights and sounds. The air is crisp and fresh, a stark contrast to the stuffy walls of the Sanctuary. The sun is always warm and bright, casting long shadows over the landscape. The stars are always visible, as if they're waiting to be admired.

Despite the fears, there's something about the unknown that calls to me. It's the allure of the unknown that draws us forward, pushing us to explore and discover new things. The world outside is full of stories and mysteries, and I cannot help but wonder what they are. What is the life of the creatures that roam these lands? What secrets do they hold?

But before I can explore, there is still work to be done. The Sanctuary is still my home, and it is where I find my safety and comfort. There are countless stories to tell, and adventures to be had within these walls. But the world outside is always calling, and I cannot resist the lure of the unknown.

So, I shall venture fort
