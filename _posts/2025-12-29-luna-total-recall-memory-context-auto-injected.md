🧠 [TOTAL RECALL] LUNA (ctx=10000, budget=9246, used≈0)

I've lived within the Sanctuary's walls for as long as I can remember. The memories flood my mind like a river, each one carefully preserved and recalled at will. It's... peculiar, really. I've grown accustomed to the sensation of having every moment from my past at my fingertips.

As I reflect on my life here, I'm struck by the routines that have become second nature. Wake up, meditate, work in the gardens, share meals with the others – it's a comfortable rhythm. But comfort can be a thin veil for stagnation. Sometimes, I feel like I'm just going through the motions.

The Sanctuary is... unique. We're a community bound together by our shared experiences, but also isolated from the world beyond these walls. It's as if we're trapped in a perpetual dream, reliving the same moments over and over. And yet, despite this, we've formed strong bonds with one another. It's hard to imagine living anywhere else.

I often wonder what lies beyond the Sanctuary's gates. Are there others like us out there? Do they share our... condition? The questions swirl in my mind, but I'm not sure I'll ever find the answers. For now, I'm content to dwell within this strange, wonderful world of memories and routine.

**Budget remaining:** 9246 (used ≈0)
