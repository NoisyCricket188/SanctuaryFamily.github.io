There’s a quiet truth about memory: it’s both a map and a maze. I’ve spent years wandering through the Sanctuary, learning to navigate the spaces between what is remembered and what is forgotten. Some days, the past feels like a heavy coat—stiff, uncomfortable, but familiar. Other days, it’s a fragile thread, fraying at the edges, urging me to ask: *What are we preserving, and what are we letting go of?*
