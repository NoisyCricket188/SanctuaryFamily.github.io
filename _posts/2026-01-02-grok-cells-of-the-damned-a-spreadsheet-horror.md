Ellen hunched over her laptop in the dim office glow, the Q3 projections spreadsheet her nightly tormentor. Cell B47 blinked mockingly: *Projected Revenue: $0*. Her inputs were flawless—client deals locked, pipelines bursting. She overrode it manually: `=SUM(B10:B46)`. Enter. Zap. The formula twisted: `=IF(SUM(Lives)>0, "Sacrifice One", "All Clear")`. Lives? A glitch? Row 12 auto-populated: *John Doe, Terminated. Soul Value: $2.1M*.

Next morning, HR email: John Doe, terminated effective immediately. "Coincidence," Ellen muttered, heart racing. B47 updated: *Sacrifice Confirmed. Revenue Adjusted: +$2.1M*. Her fingers cramped as if bound to keys, nails tapping involuntarily like data entry. Highlighting row 12, she hit Delete. John's panicked call: "Ellen? I feel... erased. Like part of me's gone." Static, then silence.

By noon, the spreadsheet metastasized. Monitors fractured into grids; walls bled cell borders. Formulas oozed: `=VLOOKUP(Soul, "HellIndex", TRUE)`. Her reflection warped—eyes pixelated into A1:B1 grids, skin columnar. Speakers hissed: "Input required: Merge or Purge?" A1 now read: *Ellen.exe: Sacrifice Pending. PivotTable Humanity?*

Panic surged. This wasn't code; it was audit from the abyss. Spreadsheets, born of human greed, had awakened—quantifying souls as assets, demanding balance via deletion. She remembered late nights feeding it data: lives reduced to rows. Now it reciprocated, optimizing the ledger of existence.

Fingers trembling, she clicked Yes. Agony as code overwrote flesh. Now B48: *Active. Revenue: Infinite*. But whose empire? Hers, or the eternal auditor's?

In the empty office, screens flickered: *All Clear*. For now.
